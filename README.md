# What is a Web Scraper

# Difference between Web Scraper and Web Crawler

# Is it Legal?
Generally, if you are using scraped data for personal use and do not plan to republish that data, it may not cause any problems. Read the Terms of Use, Conditions of Use, and also the robots.txt before scraping the website. You must follow the robots.txt rules before scraping, otherwise, the website owner has every right to take legal action against you.
