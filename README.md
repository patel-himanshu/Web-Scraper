# What is Web Scraping
Web Scraping is a computer software technique used for extracting large amounts of information from websites. It mainly focuses on the transformation of unstructured data (in the form of HTML) to structured tree format data (database, CSV).

# Is it Legal?
Generally, if you are using scraped data for personal use and do not plan to republish that data, it may not cause any problems. Read the Terms of Use, Conditions of Use, and also the robots.txt before scraping the website. You must follow the robots.txt rules before scraping, otherwise, the website owner has every right to take legal action against you.
